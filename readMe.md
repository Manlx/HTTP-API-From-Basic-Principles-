# Project Standards
Everything needs to be as type safe as possible when utilizing JSDoc

# External Packages
No external package should be required for this. Everything needs to be written from basic principles and the provided NodeJs modules (This project requires at least Node 24 to run)
With the exception of Nodemon, this is purely for devEx.
